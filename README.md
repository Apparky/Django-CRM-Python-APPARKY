## Step 1:

Create a Folder first and open it from `CMD` (Windows) or your native `terminal`

Install [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to your system by using this `command`

```commandline
pip install django
```

We have shared `requirement.txt` file with this repo. You can also install all required libraries by following this command

```commandline
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

If done, create a new project file by typing this

```commandline
django-admin startproject YOURPROJECTNAME .
# In this project is the name of it is MyCRM.
```

That's all. All your Native file will be created to yhe folder, and you are ready to start
